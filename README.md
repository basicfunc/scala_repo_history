# The GitHub History of the Scala Language
## Introduction
For this project, I will be working with the real-world repository of the Scala programming language, which is stored in both a version control system (Git) and a project hosting site (GitHub). The repository contains a vast amount of information, including the entire development history of the language, with nearly 30,000 commits and a history that spans more than a decade. Your task will be to read and analyze this data, cleaning it up as necessary, and creating visualizations to understand the development of Scala and identify the key contributors and experts.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x (I used 3.10)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python Libraries: `pandas, matplotlib, numpy`

## Data
The data for this project was obtained from Datacamp. It includes three datasets,

1. `pulls_2011-2013.csv` contains the basic information about the pull requests, and spans from the end of 2011 up to (but not including) 2014.

2. `pulls_2014-2018.csv` contains identical information and spans from 2014 up to 2018.

3. `pull_files.csv` contains the files that were modified by each pull request.

## Analysis
We will begin by importing the necessary libraries and reading in the data. Then, we will explore the data to get a better understanding how all three datasets are linked to each other. We will also create visualizations to better understand the relationship between different variables.

Next,we will need to read and clean up this data, and then use it to create visualizations that help understand the development of Scala and identify the key contributors and experts. 

## Conclusion
By completing this project, we have answers to following *Questions*:

- Who are the most active contributors to the Scala project, in terms of the number of commits they have made or the lines of code they have added or modified?
Which individuals or organizations have had the most influence on the direction of the Scala project, based on the content and impact of their contributions?

- How has the Scala project evolved over time, in terms of the volume of contributions, the areas of the codebase that have seen the most activity, and the types of changes that have been made?

- What are the most significant features or improvements that have been added to Scala, and who were the key contributors to their development?
